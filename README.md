HashWatchr Free
==========

Description
===========

CloudMinr's HashWatchr is a WordPress plugin that provides a customizable dashboard by polling [MPOS](https://github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) (by [TheSerapher](https://github.com/TheSerapher)) Pools for statistical information on Workers.

It was created by [Chris MacKay](https://www.google.com/+ChrisMacKay) with [CloudMinr](https://www.github.com/CloudMinr) and is released under the FreeBSD license for all to use as they please.

Problems or issues can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/CloudMinr/HashWatchr-Free/issues) or in #HashWatchr on irc.freenode.net.

**NOTE**: This project is still under development and commits are happening regularly. I do not recommend using this code for a production setup as of yet and should wait for the Release. Anyone willing to test HashWatchr and provide feedback is greatly appreciated, though!
